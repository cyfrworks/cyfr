# Contributing to CYFR

Thanks for your interest in improving CYFR. Issues and pull requests are
welcome.

## Licensing of contributions (inbound = outbound)

CYFR uses **mixed per-file licensing** (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and
[`FAIR_SOURCE.md`](FAIR_SOURCE.md)). Contributions are accepted under the
license of the **file being changed**:

- Files under `apps/sanctum/**` are **FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0**. Contributions
  to those files are made under FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0.
- Every other file is **Apache-2.0**. Contributions to those files are made
  under Apache-2.0.

By submitting a contribution, you agree to license it under the license that
already applies to the file(s) you change. There is no separate CLA and no
sign-off requirement.

## New files

Open every source file with the SPDX header that matches the directory it
lives in, after a shebang line if it has one, in the file's own comment
syntax:

```
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
# Copyright 2026 CYFR Works Inc.
```

(use `FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0` only for files inside `apps/sanctum/`).

The `license-lint` workflow enforces this boundary on every pull request for
Elixir, Go, WIT, the console's JavaScript and the backends image suite — a
missing or wrong header fails CI.

## Before opening a PR

- Read [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) first. A change to a principle, a
  layer edge, a port or an invariant changes that document in the same pull
  request.
- Keep changes focused and match the surrounding code style.
- Run the tests for what you touched as operating-system partitions:
  `scripts/test-partitioned.sh <test paths>` on SQLite, and
  `scripts/test-partitioned.sh -a postgres <test paths>` on PostgreSQL.
  CI runs the whole suite on both.
- If you changed a `@spec` or a function's return shape, run `mix dialyzer`.
  CI runs it too. It is fast once the PLT is built, and the findings it
  reports today are recorded in [`.dialyzer_ignore.exs`](.dialyzer_ignore.exs)
  — fixing one means deleting its line there, since a filter that no longer
  matches also fails the build.
- Don't describe the product as "open source" in user-facing copy — it is
  "Fair Source" / "source available" (see [`FAIR_SOURCE.md`](FAIR_SOURCE.md)).
