# Contributing to CYFR

Thanks for your interest in improving CYFR. Issues and pull requests are
welcome.

## Licensing of contributions (inbound = outbound)

CYFR uses **mixed per-file licensing** (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and
[`FAIR_SOURCE.md`](FAIR_SOURCE.md)). Contributions are accepted under the
license of the **file being changed**:

- Files under `apps/sanctum/**` are **FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0**. Contributions
  to those files are made under FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0.
- Every other file is **Apache-2.0**. Contributions to those files are made
  under Apache-2.0.

By submitting a contribution, you agree to license it under the license that
already applies to the file(s) you change. There is no separate CLA and no
sign-off requirement.

## New files

Open every source file with the SPDX header that matches the directory it
lives in, after a shebang line if it has one, in the file's own comment
syntax:

```
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
# Copyright 2026 CYFR Works Inc.
```

(use `FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0` only for files inside `apps/sanctum/`).

The `license-lint` workflow enforces this boundary on every pull request for
Elixir, Go, WIT, the console's JavaScript and the backends image suite — a
missing or wrong header fails CI.

## Before opening a PR

- Consult [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) when deciding ownership,
  changing a layer edge, a port or an invariant, or resolving an unclear
  architectural contract. A change to a principle, a layer edge, a port or an
  invariant changes that document in the same pull request.
- Keep changes focused and match the surrounding code style.
- Every component is validated by the pinned `wasm-tools`, which the dev
  and test configurations name at `_tools/wasm-tools`, and the application
  refuses to start without it: install it once with
  `scripts/wasm-tools.sh install _tools` (`scripts/test-partitioned.sh`
  installs it when it is missing).
- The tests tagged `:requires_cargo_component` build real components, and
  the test helpers exclude them where `cargo-component` is not on `PATH`.
  CI runs them on both adapters, so install it
  (`cargo install cargo-component --locked`) with the `wasm32-wasip1` and
  `wasm32-wasip2` targets on rustup's default toolchain: a build runs
  outside the checkout, where `rust-toolchain.toml` does not choose the
  toolchain. `scripts/commit-gate.sh` looks for it in
  `${CARGO_HOME:-~/.cargo}/bin` and on `PATH`, and refuses to run without it.
- Run the tests for what you touched as operating-system partitions:
  `scripts/test-partitioned.sh <test paths>` on SQLite, and
  `scripts/test-partitioned.sh -a postgres <test paths>` on PostgreSQL.
  CI runs the whole suite on both. After a run,
  `scripts/test-partitioned.sh -- --failed` with the same `-a` reruns
  exactly the failures every partition recorded: each adapter keeps its
  record under its own build path. `mix test --failed` reads SQLite's;
  it reaches PostgreSQL's only with
  `MIX_BUILD_PATH=_build/test_pg CYFR_DATABASE=postgres`. The split
  weighs each file by `scripts/test-partition-weights.tsv`; to regenerate
  it, move it aside, make two runs of
  `CYFR_TEST_TIMINGS_DIR=<dir> scripts/test-partitioned.sh -n 8 -- --formatter ExUnit.CLIFormatter --formatter Prima.Test.TimingFormatter`,
  each into a fresh directory, and keep each file's larger
  `elixir scripts/test-timings.exs weights <dir>` value, as its header
  says.
- If you changed a `@spec` or a function's return shape, run `mix dialyzer`.
  CI runs it too. It is fast once the PLT is built, and the findings it
  reports today are recorded in [`.dialyzer_ignore.exs`](.dialyzer_ignore.exs)
  — fixing one means deleting its line and its reason there, since a filter
  that no longer matches also fails the build.
- Don't describe the product as "open source" in user-facing copy — it is
  "Fair Source" / "source available" (see [`FAIR_SOURCE.md`](FAIR_SOURCE.md)).
